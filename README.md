This project proposal presents the design and development of a delivery drone powered by a Raspberry Pi, a small
single-board computer. The drone aims to solve the need for a
fast and efficient delivery system by using the Raspberry Pi for
navigation and control functions. The Raspberry Pi also allows
for easy customization and upgrading of the drone’s software,
making it adaptable to various delivery scenarios. The drone
consists of various components including motors, propellers, a
flight controller, electronic speed controllers, a frame, a radio
control receiver, a remote controller, batteries, a camera, a GPS
module, and sensors. The Raspberry Pi is connected to these
components through cables and connectors, and the GPS module,
sensors, and wireless communication module are connected via
a serial connection. The results of using a Raspberry Pi in a
delivery drone include faster delivery times, lower cost, easy
customization, and reliable navigation. Future improvements for
the drone include increasing the range through improved battery
technology or a system for swapping out batteries on-the-fly,
improving visual tracking and obstacle avoidance, and expanding
the payload capacity.
